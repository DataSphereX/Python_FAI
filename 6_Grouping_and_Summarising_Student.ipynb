    "# Grouping and Summarising Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping and aggregation are some of the most frequently used operations in data analysis, especially while doing exploratory data analysis (EDA), where comparing summary statistics across groups of data is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g., in the retail sales data we are working with, you may want to compare the average sales of various regions, or compare the total profit of two customer segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping analysis can be thought of as having three parts:\n",
    "1. **Splitting** the data into groups (e.g. groups of customer segments, product categories, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Applying** a function to each group (e.g. mean or total sales of each customer segment)\n",
    "3. **Combining** the results into a data structure showing the summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through some examples."
